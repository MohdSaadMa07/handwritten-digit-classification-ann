# handwritten-digit-classification-ann
Handwritten Digit Classification built using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) trained on the MNIST dataset. The model uses ReLU and Softmax activations and achieves an ~95–97% accuracy. This project demonstrates end-to-end deep learning workflow including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and performance analysis.
